This is a client side minetest mod.  
Your player name can't be detected automatically by the mod yet.  
As workaround you need to type ```hello  ``` (hello and two spaces) in chat to make the mod know your name.

* Highlights a message if you are mentioned in it
* Every player gets a different colour (near to white).
* You can give players different chat priorities using ```/chatcolour```.
* Of course, tab autocompletion isntyet available that you don't have to type so much (https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/5532)
